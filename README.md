# Doctor System

The Doctor System is a comprehensive software application developed in C# to assist doctors in determining appropriate care for patients based on various factors such as test results, demographics, and health indicators. This project was created as part of a bachelor's degree program and encompasses real-life medical care recommendations derived from a variety of scholarly sources.

## Features

* Doctor Registration: Doctors can register and create accounts within the system to access patient data and provide care recommendations.
* Patient Management: Each doctor can add and manage patient details, including demographic information and health status.
* Health Assessment: The system allows doctors to input patient test results, such as blood tests, and additional health indicators.
* Care Recommendations: Based on the patient's information and test results, the system suggests appropriate care options for the doctor to consider.
* User Interface: The user interface is built using Windows Forms, providing a user-friendly environment for doctors to interact with the system.

## Technologies Used
* C#: The primary programming language used for developing the application.
* Windows Forms: Utilized for building the graphical user interface (GUI) of the application.
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Employed OOP principles for designing modular and maintainable code.

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have the .NET Framework installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/doctor-system.git
cd doctor-system
```
3. Open the solution file (DoctorSystem.sln) in Visual Studio.
4. Build the solution and run the application.

## Usage
* Upon launching the Doctor System application, doctors can log in using their registered credentials.
* Once logged in, doctors can add new patients, input patient test results, and receive care recommendations.
* Doctors can view patient details, including demographic information and health status, and update records as needed.
